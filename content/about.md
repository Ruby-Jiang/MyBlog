Hey, welcome to my personal blog. Sometimes people tend to identify the reasons for which actions are performed and what we desire to bring about. For me it's just a sudden impluse that one night my ears hear a word behind me, saying, "This is the way, you're gonna make the coolest game in the world! Walk in it. ðŸ˜‡"

This blog will mainly be my game logs and updates about the developing process and hopefully the post mortem later. Without the use of blogs for the supervision and review it could be hard to persisit on. I will add some of my jottings and algorithm notes regarding I'm still seeking for a full-time job after graduation.
